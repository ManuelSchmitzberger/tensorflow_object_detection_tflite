**System Environment**:

System: Ubuntu 18.04

Opencv: opencv 4.1.0

**Instructions**:

1. Run demo.cpp on x86 unbuntu, make sure opencv and bazel are installed.
    1. Build libtensorflowlite.so, under the tensorflow directory.
    ```
                bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/lite:libtensorflowlite.so --fat_apk_cpu=arm64-v8a
    ```
    2. Move .so to **tensorflow_object_detection_tflite/lib**
    3. Change **find_library(TFLITE_LIBRARY tensorflow-lite "lib")** to **find_library(TFLITE_LIBRARY tensorflowlite "lib")** in **CMakeLists.txt**.
    4. Build cmake
    ```
            mkdir build
            cd build
            cmake ..
            make -j
            ./demo
    ```
2. Run demo.cpp on arm64-v8a ubuntu.
    1. Intall opencv on your arm64 motherboard.
    2. Build libtensorflow-lite.a, followed by the tensorflow tutorial https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/build_arm64. Careful about the arm version, v7 or v8.
    3. Move .a to **tensorflow_object_detection_tflite/lib**
    4. keep find_library(TFLITE_LIBRARY tensorflow-lite "lib") unchanged.
    5. Build cmake
    ```
            mkdir build
            cd build
            cmake ..
            make -j
            ./demo
    ```
3. If there is a flatbuffers error, build flatbuffers on your desktop, and use its header files and .a lib file, put and replace them into tensorflow_object_detection_tflite/include and tensorflow_object_detection_tflite/lib, respectively. You can check here to know how to build. https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/5569#issuecomment-543777629
